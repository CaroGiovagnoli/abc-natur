This font is part of the ABC Natur project. It was developed within the framework of ArtSpring 2024. During the month of April, together with the Schleifengarten community, I built these letters with branches from the garden. A rug made by Katarina served as nodes, and the hands of BÃ¡rbara, Sol, and Gaby helped give shape and space to these signs.

This font is part of the ABC Natur project. It was developed within the framework of ArtSpring 2024. During the month of April, together with the Schleifengarten community, I built these letters with branches from the garden. A rug made by Katharina served as nodes, and the hands of BÃ¡rbara, Sol, and Gaby helped give shape and space to these signs.

A huge thank you to the group of artists who organized Art Spring 2024. It is an immense job, and you have lovingly taken care of our work.
